# Coding-Dojo-NinjaMan-Project
<h>Created a Ninja Man game on HTML &amp; CSS</h>
<p>As a first project from coding dojo i was excited.
i've always wanted to make a game one day and this was it.
The game is simple, but i also decided to add 3 pages before reaching the game.
First page describes the game and how to play.
Second shows character selection between Male Ninja & Female ninja( i plan on adding a female ninja, and to hopefully expand the world for the game).
Was a fun mini project </P>
